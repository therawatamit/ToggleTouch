# ToggleTouch
A linux program to enable/disable touch screens and other input devices. A single command for both enabling and disabling (toggling) is especially useful if used as a custom command for _hot-corners_ or other similar triggers.

## Synopsis

This program is designed for linux environments which support the `xinput` command, like Ubuntu and Linux-Mint. It is especially useful if used in conjuncton with hot-corner triggers such as the ones available with Unity or Cinnamon, on [Ubuntu](http://techgotcha.com/hot-corners-in-ubuntu/) and [Linux-Mint](http://www.zdnet.com/article/hands-on-with-mint-cinnamons-hot-corners/) respectively. Additionally, the program can be used to control any input device, not just the touch screen.

## Setup

#### To Install:

When installing ToggleTouch for the first time, use these commands. If you just want to update your version, go to the [update](#to-update) section instead.

1. Download the files `install-toggletouch.sh` and `ToggleTouch.sh`.
2. Move the files to your home directory. 
3. Run the command `sh install-toggletouch.sh` from the terminal.
4. Enter the root password when prompted.
5. When asked, inform ToggleTouch of the current state of your touch screen (or other input device).

#### To Run:

From the terminal, use the command `toggletouch` to toggle the state of your touchscreen. The same command can be assigned a trigger such as a hot-corner, for greater utility. To configure for other input devices:

1. Run the `xinput` command on your terminal.
2. Note the name of the device you wish to enable/disable from the list displayed.
3. From the name of your choice, determine a word unique only to this device.
3. Use the command `toggletouch <NAME>`, where _<Name>_ is a single, unique word enough to identify a line from the output of `xinput`.

#### To Update:

If you're using an old version of ToggleTouch, and want to update to a newer version, follow the following commands:

1. Download the files `update-toggletouch.sh` and `ToggleTouch.sh`.
2. Move the files to your home directory. 
3. Run the command `sh update-toggletouch.sh` from the terminal.
4. Enter the root password if prompted.
